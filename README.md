# Rubik's Cube Game
The Rubik's Cube game is a 3D simulation built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js. Players can interact with and solve a virtual cube through smooth animations and intuitive controls, with features like scrambling, layer rotations, and time tracking for an engaging experience.

# 3D Rubik's Cube Game

A 3D interactive Rubik's Cube simulation built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js. This project allows users to experience the fun of solving a Rubik's Cube directly in their browser with realistic visuals and intuitive controls.

## Features
- **3D Cube Rendering**: The cube is rendered using `Three.js` for smooth and realistic 3D visuals.
- **User Interaction**: Rotate and manipulate the cube using mouse or touch interactions.
- **Scramble Functionality**: Start from a scrambled cube with random moves.
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions and rotations are enhanced by custom easing animations.
- **Time Tracking**: Keep track of how long it takes to solve the cube.
- **Mobile and Desktop Support**: Responsive design that works across various devices.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aisha-Fathima/rubiks-cube-game.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
- **Scramble the Cube**: Press the scramble button to mix up the cube.
- **Rotate the Cube**: Click and drag the cube layers to rotate.
- **Solve the Cube**: Use your puzzle-solving skills to align all the cube's faces.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Three.js** - For rendering 3D graphics and interactions.

## How It Works
- The game uses `Three.js` to create the 3D cube model.
- Players can interact with the cube using a combination of raycasting and drag events to rotate specific layers.
- The cube can be scrambled via a built-in function, generating a series of random moves.
- Timing functions are used to keep track of how long the player takes to solve the cube.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for larger cubes (e.g., 4x4, 5x5).
- Implement undo/redo functionality for moves.
- Add customizable themes and cube colors.
- Implement a leaderboard for solving times.
